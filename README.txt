DATA: National Parks Service species and their characteristics.

Public Domain. https://www.kaggle.com/nationalparkservice/park-biodiversity
We used the "species.csv" and "parks.csv" links from this page.

STATUS: Users can use the species classification page to return a list of species based on classification selections like category or order. Users do not have to make a selection in every column in order to see a list of species; users can click the search button after any number of selections. The species in the list are clickable; however, some of the species information is undefined. The search bar, Home, and Species Info pages are present, but we did not have time to implement them.

NOTES: Thank you!
